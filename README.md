## 📧 Spam Email Detection using Scikit-learn

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a predictive machine learning model using Scikit-learn to classify emails or messages as Spam or Not Spam.
It uses text preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and a Naive Bayes classifier to perform binary classification.

## 🎯 Objective

To create a supervised machine learning model

To classify text messages as Spam or Not Spam

To evaluate the model using standard performance metrics

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

Type: Supervised Learning

Problem: Binary Classification

Algorithm Used: Multinomial Naive Bayes

Feature Extraction: TF-IDF Vectorization

    ├── README.md

## 🧾 Dataset

A sample dataset of text messages is used where:

message → email/text content (feature)

label → classification

    1 = Spam
    
    0 = Not Spam

Example:

Message	Label
Win free money now	Spam
Let’s meet tomorrow	Not Spam
⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Steps Implemented

Imported required libraries

Created a labeled dataset

Split data into training and testing sets

Converted text data into numerical features using TF-IDF

Trained a Naive Bayes classifier

Evaluated the model using:

Accuracy score

Classification report

Tested the model with new input messages

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

These metrics help measure the effectiveness of the spam detection system.

## 🧪 Sample Prediction
predict_spam("You have won a free gift")
# Output: SPAM

## ✅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to text classification problems like spam detection. Using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes provides a simple yet effective approach for handling text-based data.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Use a real-world dataset (e.g., Kaggle spam dataset)

Try other classifiers like Logistic Regression or SVM

Add a confusion matrix visualization

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
